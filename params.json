You can write native apps in HTML and Javascript with node-webkit. It also lets you to call Node.js modules directly from DOM and enables a new way of writing native applications with all Web technologies.\r\n\r\n> It's created and developed in Intel Open Source Technology Center.\r\n\r\n### Apache Sling\r\n\r\n[https://sling.apache.org/](https://sling.apache.org/)\r\n\r\n> Apache Sling is a web framework that uses a Java Content Repository, such as Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage content.\r\n\r\n> Sling applications use either scripts or Java servlets, selected based on simple name conventions, to process HTTP requests in a RESTful way.\r\n\r\n> The embedded Apache Felix OSGi framework and console provide a dynamic runtime environment, where code and content bundles can be loaded, unloaded and reconfigured at runtime.\r\n\r\n> As the first web framework dedicated to JSR-170 Java Content Repositories, Sling makes it very simple to implement simple applications, while providing an enterprise-level framework for more complex applications.\r\n\r\n### Cloud9 IDE\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/)\r\n\r\n> Cloud9 is an open source IDE built with Node.JS on the back-end and JavaScript/HTML5 on the client. It is very actively maintained by about 20 developers in both Amsterdam and San Francisco and is one component of the hosted service at c9.io. The version available here runs on your local system.\r\n\r\n> Cloud9 balances the power of traditional desktop IDEs with the simplicity and elegance of editors like TextMate and Sublime.\r\n\r\n> Cloud9 is built entirely on a web stack, making it the most hacker-friendly IDE today. Fork it, hack it, and if you think others would benefit, issue a pull request on this repo and we'll take a look.
